## Assignment Description
This TicTacToe game is created using Java Swing and AWT, with a simple and intuitive 
3x3 grid layout managed by GridLayout. Each cell in the grid is represented by a JButton that 
captures user input through action listeners. Players alternate turns, with buttons updating to 
show “X” or “O” in different colors. The game checks for win conditions after every move by 
evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals, and it automatically resets the board upon a win or 
draw. The overall design focuses on simplicity and user experience, leveraging built-in Java GUI 
components for an appealing and intuitive interface.
